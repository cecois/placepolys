Not technically a fork, but ultimately born of OCPolygonizer, which essentially grew into a conflation of two fairly distinct projects. This is the piece that focuses on finding and collecting polygonal representations of geographic places from across several different open data sources. It takes some pieces of OCPolygonizer but ultimately this is a more generalized version (read:can be used by actual people) of what began to grow over there.
